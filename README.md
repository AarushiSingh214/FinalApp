## Three App Ideas
1. An app that ranks food according to location
2. An app that keeps track of the rewards/memberships of stores
3. An app that's similar to doordash but it provides services.

## Overview
### Description for App Idea 1
This would be an app that allows the user to make an account and search a food that they want to eat tonight and it would show the top rankings of the food in your area(it would display from best to worst based on ranking). You can also expand the area you are looking in, whether that is your town or state. It could give you a ranking of that food place, give you a chance to give a review and connect to google maps so that you can have directions on how to get there.  

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential so that users can easily find the best food options based on ranking and reviews and so they can also find directions using google maps. 
- **Story:** Allows users to find the best ranking of food based on a specific location and gives them access to reviews from others too
- **Market:** Anyone who wants good food! Maybe tourists or people who are just generally new in the area.
- **Habit:** People would be using this app constantly when in new places so they can find the best types of foods in the area.
- **Scope:** V1 would be the sign up or login page. V2 would have a search bar and maybe display the user's past favorites. V3 would be after the user searches for a food like pizza. Then it would display a list of the best pizza places in the area. V4 would be when the user clicks on a food place that they like and this would allow them to look at this places's menu or link to their website. phone number and google maps so they can get directions. They would also get reviews from other people on this page and ranking and give you a chance to give a review. Other V could be the screen if they want directions to the food place or a screen to read blogs.
